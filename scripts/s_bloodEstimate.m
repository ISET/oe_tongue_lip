%  We take the oxy blood absorption into account.  Starting with the raw
%  measurement, we divide by different amounts of blood.  Probably the
%  blood spectral absorption curve changes shape a bit as the concentration
%  changes.  We should really take the absorbance, scale it, and then
%  convert that to absorption.
